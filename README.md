## What is this?

CMSC335 is a relatively introduction front-end development course at UMD. I thought it'd be cool to take the example HTML that the professor walks through and add CSS to it to make it prettier. Each component in this repository is the provided HTML (with some MINOR tweaks [adding classNames, ids, divs]), but a different day.

Each class is 1 hour and 15 minutes, so the CSS for each day is done in that amount of time.
